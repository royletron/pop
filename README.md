# Artists Table

A sample React front end application that lists artists and allows filtering and ordering of them.

## Getting Started

Just check out the repository and then run:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then boot Webpack-dev-server (which will do everything else) using

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default you can then find the running application at `http://localhost:3333/`. There are also a series of tests written in Jest, using the new snapshot feature to compare the output of the component against a pre-rendered (a.k.a known good) version. To test use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g jest
npm test
```
